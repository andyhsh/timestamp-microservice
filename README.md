# Timestamp Microservice

## Description

Build an api that satisfies the user stories below. The deployed app can be found on https://json-timestamp-api.herokuapp.com/.

## Requirements

1.  User Story: I can pass a string as a parameter, and it will check to see whether that string contains either a unix timestamp or a natural language date (example: January 1, 2016).

2.  User Story: If it does, it returns both the Unix timestamp and the natural language form of that date.

3.  User Story: If it does not contain a date or Unix timestamp, it returns null for those properties.
